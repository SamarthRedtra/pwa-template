## PWA Template

The [PWA Builder](https://github.com/aerele/pwa-builder.git) uses this Frappe app template.

PWA Builder generates metadata and this template consumes it. As a result, a Frappe app is made available which can be installed to your site. On installation, `https://<your-sitename>/pwa-app-name` will give you the PWA.

This is a hobby project by developers at Aerele Technologies.
